 Special Agent Oso YTP 2015 (updated thing)

If you wish to take, give credit like this: Thanks to RandomEffectsYTP for the .vf file. Here's his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6u_mDelLgsMIoW2H3nbHKQ

Your also allowed to request specialized .vfs that you want to replace. For example, a sentence-mixcore of Michael Rosen
