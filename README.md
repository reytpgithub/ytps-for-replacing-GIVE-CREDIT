# ytps-for-replacing-GIVE-CREDIT
take to replace, but give credit

If you wish to take, give credit like this: Thanks to RandomEffectsYTP for the .vf file. Here's his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6u_mDelLgsMIoW2H3nbHKQ

# I will email you the .vfs, but you have to email me a request to lemasterofegg114@gmail.com.

.vfs currently available: Special Agent Oso YTP (2015 version alpha, minor edits)
Your also allowed to request specialized .vfs that you want to replace. For example, a sentence-mixcore of Michael Rosen
or a brain-rape of the Big Bang Theory Show (which is a YTP that I have planned).
